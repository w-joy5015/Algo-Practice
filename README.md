# Algo Practice

Inspired by ZResnick's Algorama repository, this repo is a space where I practice algorithms and problem sets for technical challenges. It may also include files where I practice my React, HTML, and other frontend skills.

## Material so far
 - implement a binary tree
 - implement a linked list

I have included unit tests for the material I've covered so far. If you are interested running these unit tests on your local cumputer, run `npm install` (after forking and cloning) and then `npm test`.
